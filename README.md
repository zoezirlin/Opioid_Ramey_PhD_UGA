## Updates as of October 19th: programming steps so far

#### Step 1
Importing the state CSV file, downloaded from https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/. 
Will run each state's CSV file through the following code, and then concatenate into one dataframe for further use in Stata.


#### Step 2
Creating a malleable copy of that dataframe for programming.


#### Step 3
Creating dataframe from master state CSV file to include only:
BUYER_STATE','BUYER_COUNTY','Combined_Labeler_Name','TRANSACTION_DATE','DOSAGE_UNIT','MME','dos_str'


#### Step 4
Creaing the "DOSAGE_UNIT" variable column, which is an obervation's dosage unit multiplied by its dosage strength.
al['DOSAGE_UNIT']*al['dos_str']


#### Step 5
Splitting the dates (formatted like "7032006" or "12132006" into three three variables: MONTH, YEAR, DAY.


#### Step 6
Creating new variable "MONTH_YEAR" to be formatted as "2006m3" if, for example, an obervation was made in 2006, month 3 (March of 2006.)


#### Step 7
Creating a new column labeling the binary option of PURDUE or INDUSTRY, to segment the observations into two possible categories: Purdue pharmaceutical company or non-purdue pharma.


#### Step 8
Importing the FIPS codes to be merged into state dataframe


#### Step 9.A
Creating the final state dataframe A by aggregating data into pivot table (with either purdue or industry exploded into their own 3 variables)

#### Step 9.B
Creating the final state dataframe B by aggregating data into pivot table (with all of the pharma companies exploded into their own 3 variables)



#### Step 10
Finalizing the variable/column names and exporting into the state's own CSV file ðŸ˜Š


#### Step 11
Once each state has its own CSV file, concatenate all 50 files one on top of the other for final set
